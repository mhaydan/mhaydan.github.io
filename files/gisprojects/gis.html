      <h4>GDP & Density Analysis, Rheine-Alpine Corridor/EU</h4>
      <h2>Integrated Project III, M.Sc.</h2>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        The Rhine Alpine Corridor is a pivotal economic region in Europe, characterized by several major urban centers driving growth. However, this concentration of economic activity also presents significant challenges, including inequality, traffic congestion, high housing costs, and environmental degradation. Low-income areas in high-density cities like Oberhausen and Liege struggle to access opportunities, exacerbating issues of social cohesion.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />

      <br />
      <p>
        Using GIS analysis, this project explores strategies for promoting balanced growth across the region. Key recommendations include implementing polycentric urban development to decentralize economic activity and enhance urban densification in high-income areas, alongside targeted industrial developments in low-income regions to mitigate economic disparities. The GIS analysis also highlights the need for investments in infrastructure—such as high-speed rail links, expanded public transportation, and improved communication networks between borders—as well as the development of affordable housing and community facilities. These investments should be tailored to the unique characteristics and needs of diverse communities within the Rhine Alpine Corridor.
      </p>

      <br />
      <p>
        Through GIS mapping and spatial analysis, the project underscores the importance of a collaborative approach to agglomeration. By fostering equitable growth and enhancing infrastructure and services across all communities, the region can ensure that the benefits of economic activity and population density are widely shared, addressing the complex challenges inherent in the Rhine Alpine Corridor.

      <h4>Movement and Morphology Analysis, Amsterdam/NL</h4>
      <h2>Integrated Project II, M.Sc.</h2>

        Aiming towards sustainability, the world is now shifting to a pedestrian and cycling-based spatial development. With the trend of work-from home culture, it is very important to have the basic amenities within walking distance such as retail, gym, or leisure in a residential  environment. In the mobility index of Auckland, the study was carried out to analyze the spatial development and behavior of the pedestrians in Auckland. The index based on the facilities in the range of 1.5 km from each household. In the process of mapping walkability index, four weighted factors considered to form the equation: Transport Index x1.5 + Accessibility Index x1.3 + Safety Index x1.3 + Quality Index x1

      <h4>Interactive Mapping w/Spatial Data, Düsseldorf/DE</h4>
      <h2>Territorial Analysis, M.Sc.</h2>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        With developing technologies, it has become crucial to gather, process and present the spatial data with using programming languages such as Python. In the given example, the practice aimed at improving skills on the language using Jupyter Notebooks as a tool with ipyleaflet. The main goal was to create an interactive map which shows the oldest three schools in Dusseldorf. 
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        The chosen dataset included necessary informations such as coordinates and names of the schools for further programming. The GeoJSON file was imported and printed with plot functions in GeoPandas library package. NumPy and MatPlotLib libraries were also used in the process. After making sure the data frame works without any bugs, the point data was coded to cluster and click-open with including location informations within Osmnx.
